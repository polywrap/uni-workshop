## Let's Get Started
Integrating and building on-top of Uniswap has never been so easy!

Today, we'll build:
1. A custom Uniswap dApp by using the Polywrap Client
2. Your own Polywrapper that uses Uniswap under-the-hood

NOTE: Polywrap used to be called "Web3API", and the code-base has not been renamed yet. Going forward you'll be seeing Web3API terminology in the demo code-bases.
